				<h3>Early life</h3>
				<img src="img/img-early.jpg.webp" alt="young princess">
				<p><span>Elizabeth</span> was born at 02:40 (GMT) on 21 April 1926,[1] during the reign of her paternal
					grandfather, King
					George V. Her father, Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), was the second son of the King.
					Her mother, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother), was the
					youngest daughter of Scottish aristocrat Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, at
					whose London home (17 Bruton Street, Mayfair) she was delivered by Caesarean section.[2] She was baptised
					by the Anglican Archbishop of York, Cosmo Gordon Lang, in the private chapel of Buckingham Palace on 29
					May,[3][b] and named Elizabeth after her mother; Alexandra after her paternal great-grandmother, who had
					died six months earlier; and Mary after her paternal grandmother.[5] Called "Lilibet" by her close
					family,[6] based on what she called herself at first,[7] she was cherished by her grandfather, George V,
					whom she affectionately called "Grandpa England",[8] and her regular visits during his serious illness in
					1929 were credited in the popular press and by later biographers with raising his spirits and aiding his
					recovery.</p>
				<p>Elizabeth's only sibling, Princess Margaret, was born in 1930. The two princesses were educated at home
					under the supervision of their mother and their governess, Marion Crawford.[10] Lessons concentrated on
					history, language, literature, and music.[11] Crawford published a biography of Elizabeth and Margaret's
					childhood years entitled The Little Princesses in 1950, much to the dismay of the royal family.[12] The
					book describes Elizabeth's love of horses and dogs, her orderliness, and her attitude of
					responsibility.[13] Others echoed such observations: Winston Churchill described Elizabeth when she was
					two as "a character. She has an air of authority and reflectiveness astonishing in an infant."[14] Her
					cousin Margaret Rhodes described her as "a jolly little girl, but fundamentally sensible and
					well-behaved".</p>

			<div id="war" class="war">
				<h3>Second World War</h3>
				<img src="img/img-war.jpg.webp" alt="Elizabeth near the car">
				<p>In September 1939, Britain entered the Second World War. Lord Hailsham suggested that Princesses
					Elizabeth and Margaret should be evacuated to Canada to avoid the frequent aerial bombings of London by
					the Luftwaffe.[24] This was rejected by their mother, who declared, "The children won't go without me. I
					won't leave without the King. And the King will never leave."[25] The princesses stayed at Balmoral
					Castle, Scotland, until Christmas 1939, when they moved to Sandringham House, Norfolk.[26] From February
					to May 1940, they lived at Royal Lodge, Windsor, until moving to Windsor Castle, where they lived for
					most of the next five years.[27] At Windsor, the princesses staged pantomimes at Christmas in aid of the
					Queen's Wool Fund, which bought yarn to knit into military garments.[28] In 1940, the 14-year-old
					Elizabeth made her first radio broadcast during the BBC's Children's Hour, addressing other children who
					had been evacuated from the cities.[29] She stated: "We are trying to do all we can to help our gallant
					sailors, soldiers, and airmen, and we are trying, too, to bear our own share of the danger and sadness of
					war. We know, every one of us, that in the end all will be well.</p>
				<p>In 1943, Elizabeth undertook her first solo public appearance on a visit to the Grenadier Guards, of
					which she had been appointed colonel the previous year.[30] As she approached her 18th birthday,
					parliament changed the law so she could act as one of five Counsellors of State in the event of her
					father's incapacity or absence abroad, such as his visit to Italy in July 1944.[31] In February 1945, she
					was appointed an honorary second subaltern in the Auxiliary Territorial Service with the service number
					of 230873.[32] She trained as a driver and mechanic and was given the rank of honorary junior commander
					(female equivalent of captain at the time) five months later.</p>
				<p>At the end of the war in Europe, on Victory in Europe Day, Elizabeth and Margaret mingled incognito with
					the celebrating crowds in the streets of London. Elizabeth later said in a rare interview, "We asked my
					parents if we could go out and see for ourselves. I remember we were terrified of being recognised ... I
					remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a
					tide of happiness and relief.</p>
				<p>During the war, plans were drawn up to quell Welsh nationalism by affiliating Elizabeth more closely with
					Wales. Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of Caernarfon Castle or a patron of Urdd Gobaith Cymru
					(the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for several reasons, including fear of associating Elizabeth
					with conscientious objectors in the Urdd at a time when Britain was at war.[37] Welsh politicians
					suggested she be made Princess of Wales on her 18th birthday. Home Secretary Herbert Morrison supported
					the idea, but the King rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince
					of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent.[38] In 1946, she was inducted into
					the Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod of Wales.</p>
				<p>Princess Elizabeth went on her first overseas tour in 1947, accompanying her parents through southern
					Africa. During the tour, in a broadcast to the British Commonwealth on her 21st birthday, she made the
					following pledge: "I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be
					devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong."[40] The
					speech was written by Dermot Morrah, a journalist for The Times.</p>

				<h3>Marriage</h3>
				<img src="img/img-marriage.jpg.webp" alt="Royal marriage">
				<p><mark>Elizabeth</mark> met her future husband, Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, in 1934 and again in
					1937.[42]
					They were second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark and third cousins through
					Queen Victoria. After meeting for the third time at the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth in July 1939,
					Elizabeth—though only 13 years old—said she fell in love with Philip, and they began to exchange
					letters.[43] She was 21 when their engagement was officially announced on 9 July 1947.[</p>
				<p>The engagement was not without controversy; Philip had no financial standing, was foreign-born (though a
					British subject who had served in the Royal Navy throughout the Second World War), and had sisters who
					had married German noblemen with Nazi links.[45] Marion Crawford wrote, "Some of the King's advisors did
					not think him good enough for her. He was a prince without a home or kingdom. Some of the papers played
					long and loud tunes on the string of Philip's foreign origin."[46] Later biographies reported that
					Elizabeth's mother had reservations about the union initially, and teased Philip as "The Hun".[47][48] In
					later life, however, the Queen Mother told biographer Tim Heald that Philip was "an English gentleman".
				</p>
				<p>Before the marriage, Philip renounced his Greek and Danish titles, officially converted from Greek
					Orthodoxy to Anglicanism, and adopted the style Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten, taking the surname of his
					mother's British family.[50] Shortly before the wedding, he was created Duke of Edinburgh and granted the
					style His Royal Highness.[51] Elizabeth and Philip were married on 20 November 1947 at Westminster Abbey.
					They received 2,500 wedding gifts from around the world.[52] Elizabeth required ration coupons to buy the
					material for her gown (which was designed by Norman Hartnell) because Britain had not yet completely
					recovered from the devastation of the war.[53] In post-war Britain, it was not acceptable for Philip's
					German relations, including his three surviving sisters, to be invited to the wedding.[54] Neither was an
					invitation extended to the Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII.</p>
				<p>Elizabeth gave birth to her first child, Prince Charles, on 14 November 1948. One month earlier, the King
					had issued letters patent allowing her children to use the style and title of a royal prince or princess,
					to which they otherwise would not have been entitled as their father was no longer a royal prince.[56] A
					second child, Princess Anne, was born on 15 August 1950.</p>
				<p>Following their wedding, the couple leased Windlesham Moor, near Windsor Castle, until July 1949,[52]
					when they took up residence at Clarence House in London. At various times between 1949 and 1951, the Duke
					of Edinburgh was stationed in the British Crown Colony of Malta as a serving Royal Navy officer. He and
					Elizabeth lived intermittently in Malta for several months at a time in the hamlet of Gwardamanġa, at
					Villa Guardamangia, the rented home of Philip's uncle, Lord Mountbatten. Their two children remained in
					Britain.</p>

			<div id="reign" class="reign">
				<h3>Reign</h3>
				<p>When her father died in February 1952, Elizabeth—then 25 years old—became queen of seven independent
					Commonwealth countries: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, and
					Ceylon (known today as Sri Lanka), as well as Head of the Commonwealth. Elizabeth reigned as a
					constitutional monarch through major political changes such as the Troubles in Northern Ireland,
					devolution in the United Kingdom, the decolonisation of Africa, and the United Kingdom's accession to the
					European Communities and withdrawal from the European Union. The number of her realms varied over time as
					territories gained independence and some realms became republics. Her many historic visits and meetings
					include state visits to China in 1986, Russia in 1994, and the Republic of Ireland in 2011, and visits
					with five popes.</p>
				<img src="img/img-reign.webp" alt="Young Queen Elizabeth II with her husband Prince Philip">
				<div class="coronation">
					<h4>Accession and coronation</h4>
					<p>George VI's health declined during 1951, and Elizabeth frequently stood in for him at public events.
						When she toured Canada and visited President Harry S. Truman in Washington, D.C., in October 1951, her
						private secretary, Martin Charteris, carried a draft accession declaration in case of the King's death
						while she was on tour.[59] In early 1952, Elizabeth and Philip set out for a tour of Australia and New
						Zealand by way of Kenya. On 6 February 1952, they had just returned to their Kenyan home, Sagana
						Lodge, after a night spent at Treetops Hotel, when word arrived of the death of George VI and
						Elizabeth's consequent accession to the throne with immediate effect. Philip broke the news to the new
						queen.[60] She chose to retain Elizabeth as her regnal name;[61] thus she was called Elizabeth II,
						which offended many Scots, as she was the first Elizabeth to rule in Scotland.[62] She was proclaimed
						queen throughout her realms and the royal party hastily returned to the United Kingdom.[63] Elizabeth
						and Philip moved into Buckingham Palace.</p>
					<p>With Elizabeth's accession, it seemed probable that the royal house would bear the Duke of Edinburgh's
						name, in line with the custom of a wife taking her husband's surname on marriage. Lord Mountbatten
						advocated the name House of Mountbatten. Philip suggested House of Edinburgh, after his ducal
						title.[65] The British prime minister, Winston Churchill, and Elizabeth's grandmother, Queen Mary,
						favoured the retention of the House of Windsor, so Elizabeth issued a declaration on 9 April 1952 that
						Windsor would continue to be the name of the royal house. The Duke complained, "I am the only man in
						the country not allowed to give his name to his own children."[66] In 1960, the surname
						Mountbatten-Windsor was adopted for Philip and Elizabeth's male-line descendants who do not carry
						royal titles.</p>
					<p>Amid preparations for the coronation, Princess Margaret told her sister she wished to marry Peter
						Townsend, a divorcé‚ 16 years Margaret's senior and with two sons from his previous marriage. The
						Queen asked them to wait for a year; in the words of her private secretary, "the Queen was naturally
						sympathetic towards the Princess, but I think she thought—she hoped—given time, the affair would peter
						out."[68] Senior politicians were against the match and the Church of England did not permit
						remarriage after divorce. If Margaret had contracted a civil marriage, she would have been expected to
						renounce her right of succession.[69] Margaret decided to abandon her plans with Townsend.</p>
					<p>Despite the death of Queen Mary on 24 March 1953, the coronation went ahead as planned on 2 June, as
						Mary had requested before she died.[71] The coronation ceremony in Westminster Abbey, with the
						exception of the anointing and communion, was televised for the first time.[72][c] On Elizabeth's
						instruction, her coronation gown was embroidered with the floral emblems of Commonwealth countries.
					</p>

				<div class="decolonisation">
					<h4>Acceleration of decolonisation</h4>
					<p>The 1960s and 1970s saw an acceleration in the decolonisation of Africa and the Caribbean. More than
						20 countries gained independence from Britain as part of a planned transition to self-government. In
						1965, however, the Rhodesian prime minister, Ian Smith, in opposition to moves towards majority rule,
						unilaterally declared independence while expressing "loyalty and devotion" to Elizabeth, declaring her
						"Queen of Rhodesia".[101] Although the Queen formally dismissed him, and the international community
						applied sanctions against Rhodesia, his regime survived for over a decade.[102] As Britain's ties to
						its former empire weakened, the British government sought entry to the European Community, a goal it
						achieved in 1973.</p>
					<p>The Queen toured Yugoslavia in October 1972, becoming the first British monarch to visit a communist
						country.[104] She was received at the airport by President Josip Broz Tito, and a crowd of thousands
						greeted her in Belgrade.[</p>
					<p>n February 1974, the British prime minister, Edward Heath, advised the Queen to call a general
						election in the middle of her tour of the Austronesian Pacific Rim, requiring her to fly back to
						Britain.[106] The election resulted in a hung parliament; Heath's Conservatives were not the largest
						party, but could stay in office if they formed a coalition with the Liberals. When discussions on
						forming a coalition foundered, Heath resigned as prime minister and the Queen asked the Leader of the
						Opposition, Labour's Harold Wilson, to form a government.</p>
					<p>A year later, at the height of the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis, the Australian prime
						minister, Gough Whitlam, was dismissed from his post by Governor-General Sir John Kerr, after the
						Opposition-controlled Senate rejected Whitlam's budget proposals.[108] As Whitlam had a majority in
						the House of Representatives, Speaker Gordon Scholes appealed to the Queen to reverse Kerr's decision.
						She declined, saying she would not interfere in decisions reserved by the Constitution of Australia
						for the Governor-General.[109] The crisis fuelled Australian republicanism.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="silver jubilee">
					<h4>Silver Jubilee</h4>
					<p>In 1977, Elizabeth marked the Silver Jubilee of her accession. Parties and events took place
						throughout the Commonwealth, many coinciding with her associated national and Commonwealth tours. The
						celebrations re-affirmed the Queen's popularity, despite virtually coincident negative press coverage
						of Princess Margaret's separation from her husband, Lord Snowdon.[110] In 1978, the Queen endured a
						state visit to the United Kingdom by Romania's communist leader, Nicolae Ceaușescu, and his wife,
						Elena,[111] though privately she thought they had "blood on their hands".[112] The following year
						brought two blows: one was the unmasking of Anthony Blunt, former Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures, as
						a communist spy; the other was the assassination of her relative and in-law Lord Mountbatten by the
						Provisional Irish Republican Army.</p>
					<p>According to Paul Martin Sr., by the end of the 1970s the Queen was worried the Crown "had little
						meaning for" Pierre Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister.[114] Tony Benn said the Queen found Trudeau
						"rather disappointing".[114] Trudeau's supposed republicanism seemed to be confirmed by his antics,
						such as sliding down banisters at Buckingham Palace and pirouetting behind the Queen's back in 1977,
						and the removal of various Canadian royal symbols during his term of office.[114] In 1980, Canadian
						politicians sent to London to discuss the patriation of the Canadian constitution found the Queen
						"better informed ... than any of the British politicians or bureaucrats".[114] She was particularly
						interested after the failure of Bill C-60, which would have affected her role as head of state.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="turbulent">
					<h4 class="horribilis">Turbulent 1990s and annus horribilis</h4>
					<p>On 24 November 1992, in a speech to mark the Ruby Jubilee of her accession to the throne, Elizabeth
						called 1992 her annus horribilis (a Latin phrase, meaning "horrible year").[140] Republican feeling in
						Britain had risen because of press estimates of the Queen's private wealth—contradicted by the
						Palace—and reports of affairs and strained marriages among her extended family.[141] In March, her
						second son, Prince Andrew, separated from his wife, Sarah, and Mauritius removed Elizabeth as head of
						state; her daughter, Princess Anne, divorced Captain Mark Phillips in April;[142] angry demonstrators
						in Dresden threw eggs at the Queen during a state visit to Germany in October;[143] and a large fire
						broke out at Windsor Castle, one of her official residences, in November. The monarchy came under
						increased criticism and public scrutiny.[144] In an unusually personal speech, the Queen said that any
						institution must expect criticism, but suggested it might be done with "a touch of humour, gentleness
						and understanding".[145] Two days later, Prime Minister John Major announced plans to reform the royal
						finances, drawn up the previous year, including the Queen paying income tax from 1993 onwards, and a
						reduction in the civil list.[146] In December, Prince Charles and his wife, Diana, formally
						separated.[147] At the end of the year, the Queen sued The Sun newspaper for breach of copyright when
						it published the text of her annual Christmas message two days before it was broadcast. The newspaper
						was forced to pay her legal fees and donated £200,000 to charity.[148] The Queen's solicitors had
						taken action against The Sun five years earlier for breach of copyright, after it published a
						photograph of her daughter-in-law the Duchess of York and her granddaughter Princess Beatrice. The
						case was solved with an out-of-court settlement that ordered the newspaper to pay $180,000.</p>
					<p>In January 1994, the Queen broke the scaphoid bone in her left wrist as the horse she was riding at
						Sandringham House tripped and fell.[150] In October 1994, she became the first reigning British
						monarch to set foot on Russian soil.[d][153] During the four-day visit, which is considered to be one
						of the most important foreign trips of the Queen's reign,[154] she and Philip attended events in
						Moscow and St. Petersburg.[155] In October 1995, the Queen was tricked into a hoax call by Montreal
						radio host Pierre Brassard impersonating Canadian prime minister Jean Chrétien. The Queen, who
						believed that she was speaking to Chrétien, said she supported Canadian unity, and would try to
						influence Quebec's referendum on proposals to break away from Canada.</p>
					<p>In the year that followed, public revelations on the state of Charles and Diana's marriage
						continued.[158] In consultation with her husband and John Major, as well as the Archbishop of
						Canterbury, George Carey, and her private secretary, Robert Fellowes, Elizabeth wrote to Charles and
						Diana at the end of December 1995, suggesting that a divorce would be advisable.</p>
					<p>In August 1997, a year after the divorce, Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris. The Queen was on
						holiday with her extended family at Balmoral. Diana's two sons, Princes William and Harry, wanted to
						attend church, so the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh took them that morning.[160] Afterwards, for
						five days the royal couple shielded their grandsons from the intense press interest by keeping them at
						Balmoral where they could grieve in private,[161] but the royal family's silence and seclusion, and
						the failure to fly a flag at half-mast over Buckingham Palace, caused public dismay.[131][162]
						Pressured by the hostile reaction, the Queen agreed to return to London and address the nation in a
						live television broadcast on 5 September, the day before Diana's funeral.[163] In the broadcast, she
						expressed admiration for Diana and her feelings "as a grandmother" for the two princes.[164] As a
						result, much of the public hostility evaporated.</p>
					<p>In October 1997, Elizabeth and Philip made a state visit to India, which included a controversial
						visit to the site of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre to pay her respects. Protesters chanted "Killer
						Queen, go back",[165] and there were demands for her to apologise for the action of British troops 78
						years earlier.[166] At the memorial in the park, she and the Duke paid their respects by laying a
						wreath and stood for a 30‑second moment of silence.[166] As a result, much of the fury among the
						public softened and the protests were called off.</p>
					<p>In November of that year, the Queen and her husband held a reception at Banqueting House to mark their
						golden wedding anniversary.[167] Elizabeth made a speech and praised Philip for his role as a consort,
						referring to him as "my strength and stay".</p>

				</div>
				<div class="golden jubilee">
					<h4>Golden Jubilee</h4>
					<p>On the eve of the new millennium, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh boarded a vessel from Southwark,
						bound for the Millennium Dome. Before passing under Tower Bridge, the Queen lit the National
						Millennium Beacon in the Pool of London using a laser torch.[168][169] Shortly before midnight, she
						officially opened the Dome.[170] During the singing of Auld Lang Syne, the Queen held hands with the
						Duke and British prime minister Tony Blair.</p>
					<p>In 2002, the Queen marked her Golden Jubilee, the 50th anniversary of her accession. Her sister and
						mother died in February and March respectively, and the media speculated on whether the Jubilee would
						be a success or a failure.[173] She again undertook an extensive tour of her realms, beginning in
						Jamaica in February, where she called the farewell banquet "memorable" after a power cut plunged the
						King's House, the official residence of the governor-general, into darkness.[174] As in 1977, there
						were street parties and commemorative events, and monuments were named to honour the occasion. One
						million people attended each day of the three-day main Jubilee celebration in London,[175] and the
						enthusiasm shown for the Queen by the public was greater than many journalists had anticipated.</p>
					<p>In 2003, the Queen sued Daily Mirror for breach of confidence and obtained an injunction which
						prevented the outlet from publishing information gathered by a reporter who posed as a footman at
						Buckingham Palace.[177] The newspaper also paid £25,000 towards her legal costs.[178] Though generally
						healthy throughout her life, in 2003 the Queen had keyhole surgery on both knees. In October 2006, she
						missed the opening of the new Emirates Stadium because of a strained back muscle that had been
						troubling her since the summer.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="pandemic">
					<h4>COVID-19 pandemic</h4>
					<p>On 19 March 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United Kingdom, the Queen moved to Windsor Castle
						and sequestered there as a precaution.[216] Public engagements were cancelled and Windsor Castle
						followed a strict sanitary protocol nicknamed "HMS Bubble".</p>
					<p>On 5 April, in a televised broadcast watched by an estimated 24 million viewers in the UK,[218] she
						asked people to "take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we
						will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again."[219] On 8
						May, the 75th anniversary of VE Day, in a TV broadcast at 9 p.m.—the exact time at which her father
						George VI had broadcast to the nation on the same day in 1945—she asked people to "never give up,
						never despair".[220] In October, she visited the UK's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory in
						Wiltshire, her first public engagement since the start of the pandemic.[221] On 4 November, she
						appeared masked for the first time in public, during a private pilgrimage to the Tomb of the Unknown
						Warrior at Westminster Abbey, to mark the centenary of his burial.[222] In 2021, she received her
						first and second COVID-19 vaccinations in January and April respectively.</p>
					<p>Prince Philip died on 9 April 2021, after 73 years of marriage, making Elizabeth the first British
						monarch to reign as a widow or widower since Queen Victoria.[225][226] She was reportedly at her
						husband's bedside when he died,[227] and remarked in private that his death had "left a huge
						void".[228] Due to the COVID-19 restrictions in place in England at the time, the Queen sat alone at
						Philip's funeral service, which evoked sympathy from people around the world.[229][230] In her
						Christmas broadcast that year, she paid a personal tribute to her "beloved Philip", saying, "That
						mischievous, inquiring twinkle was as bright at the end as when I first set eyes on him".[</p>
					<p>Despite the pandemic, the Queen attended the 2021 State Opening of Parliament in May,[233] and the
						47th G7 summit in June.[234] On 5 July, the 73rd anniversary of the founding of the UK's National
						Health Service, she announced that the NHS will be awarded the George Cross to "recognise all NHS
						staff, past and present, across all disciplines and all four nations".[235] In October 2021, she began
						using a walking stick during public engagements for the first time since her operation in 2004.[236]
						Following an overnight stay in hospital on 20 October, visits to Northern Ireland,[237] the COP26
						summit in Glasgow,[238] and the 2021 National Service of Remembrance were cancelled on health grounds.
					</p>

				</div>
				<div class="platinum jubilee">
					<h4>Platinum Jubilee</h4>
					<p>The Queen's Platinum Jubilee began on 6 February 2022, marking 70 years since she acceded to the
						throne on her father's death. On the eve of the date, she held a reception at Sandringham House for
						pensioners, local Women's Institute members and charity volunteers.[240] In her Accession Day message,
						Elizabeth renewed her commitment to a lifetime of public service, which she had originally made in
						1947.[</p>
					<p>Later that month, the Queen had "mild cold-like symptoms" and tested positive for COVID-19, along with
						some staff and family members.[242][243] She cancelled two virtual audiences on 22 February,[244] but
						held a phone conversation with Prime Minister Boris Johnson the following day amid a crisis on the
						Russo-Ukrainian border,[e][245] following which she made a donation to the Disasters Emergency
						Committee (DEC) Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal.[246] On 28 February, she was reported to have recovered
						and spent time with her family at Frogmore.[247] On 7 March, the Queen met Canadian prime minister
						Justin Trudeau at Windsor Castle, in her first in-person engagement since her COVID diagnosis.[248]
						She later remarked that COVID infection "leave[s] one very tired and exhausted ... It's not a nice
						result".</p>
					<p class="thanksgiving">The Queen was present at the service of thanksgiving for Prince Philip at
						Westminster Abbey on 29
						March,[250] but was unable to attend the annual Commonwealth Day service that month[251] or the Royal
						Maundy Service in April.[252] She missed the State Opening of Parliament in May for the first time in
						59 years. (She did not attend in 1959 and 1963 as she was pregnant with Prince Andrew and Prince
						Edward, respectively.)[253] In her absence, Parliament was opened by the Prince of Wales and the Duke
						of Cambridge as Counsellors of State.[254] On 17 May, the Queen officially opened the Elizabeth line
						in central London.</p>
					<p>During the Platinum Jubilee celebrations, the Queen was largely confined to balcony appearances, and
						missed the National Service of Thanksgiving.[256] For the Jubilee concert, she took part in a sketch
						with Paddington Bear, that opened the event outside Buckingham Palace.[257] On 13 June 2022, she
						became the second-longest reigning monarch in history among those whose exact dates of reign are
						known, with 70 years, 127 days reigned—surpassing King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand.[258] On 6
						September 2022, she appointed her 15th British prime minister, Liz Truss, at Balmoral Castle in
						Scotland, the first and only time she did not receive a new prime minister at Buckingham Palace during
						her reign.</p>
					<p>The Queen never planned to abdicate,[260] though she took on fewer public engagements as she grew
						older and Prince Charles took on more of her duties.[261] In June 2022, she met with the Archbishop of
						Canterbury, Justin Welby, who "came away thinking there is someone who has no fear of death, has hope
						in the future, knows the rock on which she stands and that gives her strength."</p>

				<h3>Death</h3>
				<img src="img/img-death.jpg" alt="young Elizabeth">
				<p>On 8 September 2022, Buckingham Palace announced that Elizabeth was under medical supervision at Balmoral
					Castle after doctors expressed concern. The statement read, "Following further evaluation this morning,
					Elizabeth's doctors are concerned for Her Majesty's health and have recommended she remain under medical
					supervision. The Queen remains comfortable and at Balmoral."[263][264] Elizabeth's four children, along
					with her daughters-in-law and grandsons Prince William and Prince Harry, travelled to Balmoral.[265][266]
					Her death was confirmed that evening at 18:30 BST,[267][268] setting in motion Operation London Bridge
					and, because she died in Scotland, Operation Unicorn.</p>
